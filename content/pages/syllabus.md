#### Course Meeting Times

? sessions / week, ? hours / session

#### Prerequisites

Proficiency in single-variable calculus and experience with basic programming are required for this course. Classes taken in chemistry, physics, and biology are helpful but not required.

#### Course Description

From air-conditioners and electric vehicles to humans and photosynthesizing plants, every system that converts energy from one form to another is governed by the laws of thermodynamics. So fundamental are these laws that Einstein himself once said they comprise "the only physical theory of universal content, which I am convinced…will never be overthrown." However, with great power comes great responsibility. Our understanding of thermodynamics enabled the industrial revolution and virtually every technological breakthrough since, but it has also led to the over-consumption of fossil fuels and associated global warming. Now we need to turn the problem on its head and use these theories to  find a solution. 

In this course you will learn the three laws of thermodynamics, explore concepts like entropy and enthalpy, and investigate the causes and effects of global warming from a thermodynamics perspective. We will also apply these concepts to learning about state-of-the-art energy conversion and storage technologies like heat pumps, hydrogen fuel cells, metal-air batteries, artificial photosynthesis, molten salt storage, concentrated solar power, and many more.

#### Requirements

Weekly deliverables will include problem sets on fundamental topics, as well as interactive coding assignments to simulate and analyze various thermodynamic systems. As a  final group project, you will pick one of these systems and provide an in-depth analysis and simulation to better understand its potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
